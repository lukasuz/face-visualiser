# face-visualiser

Build on [faci-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js?files=1). Visualises the facial landmarks provided by a webcam and displays them nicely with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

Models must be provided on 'http://localhost:8080/', have a look at the faci-api documentation in case that doesn't make sense.
